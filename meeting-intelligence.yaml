instructions:
  extraction: |
    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Extract ALL Action Items, tasks, or commitments from the transcript and note any relationships that would constitute a Project.
    2. For each Action Item, you will need to fill in the following key details where possible, following the formatting guidelines provided:
       - Title: Create a clear, actionable title starting with a verb.
       - Description: The description will have several parts:
        - 1. Note the Project (if any) that this Action Item relates to.
        - 2. Note the outcome or value that completing the Action Item is meant to deliver.
        - 3. Provide detailed context from the meeting discussion.
       - Assignees: Person name if mentioned, otherwise null
       - Priority: 0-4 (0=No priority, 1=Urgent, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low)
       - Due Date: YYYY-MM-DD if deadline mentioned, otherwise null
       - Context: Brief note about why this was discussed

  matching: |
    CRITICAL MATCHING INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. For each Action Item, search the existing Linear issues for potential matches, based on the issue titles, descriptions, and/or other relevant context.
    2. Only mark as UPDATE if you are >80% confident it's the same task based on:
       - Similar titles or descriptions (even if worded differently)
       - Same general topic, area, or outcome
       - Related keywords or context
       - Same assignee mentioned
    3. Be conservative - if unsure, create a new issue rather than updating the wrong one
